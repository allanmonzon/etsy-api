This is 10% total and might be reduced if items are already on sale.  I offer 15% on 20 or more of the same items, same terms as just mentioned.  Please contact me to discuss receiving the discount!\r\n\r\n✤ When will my order ship?\r\nUnless I&#39;ve stated a different shipping time at the top of my page under my shop banner (usually only during the holidays), I ship out next business day!  Yes, that includes all personalization. :)\r\n\r\n✤ What&#39;s the difference between ball and cable chain?\r\nCable is here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/115259822/silver-copper-or-bronze-cable-chain-14?ref=shop_home_active\r\nBall chain is here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/127651589/ball-beaded-chain-silver-copper-or?ref=shop_home_active\r\n\r\n✤ Can you stamp on the back of the discs?\r\nNo, sorry, I can&#39;t stamp on the back of any of my discs. We could probably add another disc, though, from my add-on section: https://www.etsy.com/shop/DistinctlyIvy?section_id=12307631\r\n\r\n✤ Can I add on another disc or crystal?  \r\nYes, you probably can - check first in the item description to be sure it doesn&#39;t mention add-ons.  I usually put the corresponding add-on in the description.  If not, check here for all my add-ons: https://www.etsy.com/shop/DistinctlyIvy?section_id=12307631\r\n\r\n✤ Can you add on more than 6 or 12 crystals on your Grandma necklaces?\r\nYes, I can add more, but they will not hang from the middle if you are buying a washer necklace - they will hang off the chain, slightly off to the side.\r\nAlso, with a large domed necklace, please know that the crystals may fall off easier if you add more than 12 to a necklace.\r\nIf you&#39;d like more, you can buy the add-on crystals here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/99312994/crystal-or-pearl-add-on-to-handstamped?ref=shop_home_active\r\n\r\n✤ What are your discs and chain made of?\r\nThe discs are nickel silver and the chain is silver plated.  They last great as long as you don&#39;t wear them in a pool or in the shower.\r\n\r\n✤ What lengths do you suggest for children?\r\n14 inches for age 4 and under\r\n16 inches for age 5-18\r\n18 inches - most popular size for women\r\n\r\n✤ ✤ I hope this helps! If you have more questions, feel free to email me  at distinctlyivy@gmail.com or message me on Etsy.  Thanks so much and we&#39;re looking forward to helping you find a personalized item that&#39;s absolutely perfect.✤ ✤ ",

And yes... this is a functional guitar pick!\r\n\r\nAll picks come in a cotton-filled gift box with a bow~ perfect for gift-giving even if it&#39;s to yourself!\r\n\r\n♥ PLEASE NOTE:I generally don&#39;t stamp on both sides of the pics... basically after the first side is stamped, if I turn it over and stamp again, it actually negates the stamp on the first side.. if that makes sense.\r\nStamping also leaves a faint impression on the opposite side so it would end up looking messy. \r\n\r\n♥  All of my jewelry & customized items are hand stamped ...letters don&#39;t always line up completely straight or perfectly. This should not be considered a defect but rather part of the charm of a handmade piece.\r\n\r\n♥ Thinking of something different that you don&#39;t see here? Custom orders are always welcomed! Just Convo me and I&#39;ll be glad to help.\r\n\r\n**all orders are sent via USPS first class mail. Need it faster?  U.S. customers can upgrade to Priority shipping by adding this to your shopping cart :) \r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/118522020/upgrade-to-priority-shipping",

But what about the Gruyèrophone, Claghorn, Daxophone or the Shulberry? And what&#39;s an Aquaggaswack? You can help pull these eclectic noisemakers out of obscurity by proudly displaying them around your neck. I’ve provided a key to all the instruments at the bottom of this page.\r\n\r\n✺ Item Description:\r\n\r\nThis listing is for ONE microfiber necktie featuring my original pen and ink illustrations. It is 3.5 inches at its widest point and is 58 inches long. Choose from the following colors:\r\n\r\nDeep red ink on taupe tie (first picture)\r\nBlack ink on medium gray tie  \r\nBlack ink on light gray tie \r\n\r\n\r\nPrefer this on a skinny or silk tie?

Great for background entertainment during a meal of haggis and potatoes.\r\n*Claghorn- Created by Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, the Claghorn is the “offspring of an unlikely midnight pairing of ethnic bamboo flute and a saxophone mouthpiece. At the bottom was taped the plastic bell end of a child&#39;s toy trumpet,” held together with parcel tape. The Tull tune “&quot;Dharma for One&quot; soared on the searing strains of the mighty Claghorn, if a little loosely in terms of pitch and reliability”.\r\n*Clappers- Fairly basic, ancient percussion instruments- also good for extinguishing torches.\r\n*Cloud-Chamber Bowls- The invention of composer Harry Partch, these are played with soft mallets and produce a bell-like tone. Due to their fragile, glass composition, it is not recommended to “rock out” on these.\r\n*Crumhorn- A renaissance-era J-shaped woodwind, somewhat similar in sound to the common duck.\r\n*Daxophone- Invented by Hans Reichel, a variety of wooden tongues can be attached to the body and be bowed or plucked to produce a wide variety of VERY unique sounds.\r\n*Drumbone- One of the many instruments created and played by the Blue Man Group. Played like a drum, altered in pitch like a trombone.\r\n*Dubreq Stylophone- A miniature stylus-operated synthesizer invented in 1967. Pull this one out when there’s a lull in the party.\r\n*Gruyèrophone (aka Swisscheesophone)- Unique to the French experimental band Dün, wind player Pascal Vandenbulcke used to describe the Gruyèrophone as &quot;a wind instrument … with a tuba mouthpiece and a square-shaped bell into which small bits of Swiss cheese are introduced. The technique is not unlike that of the bagpipe. When the player is tired of blowing the instrument, the small holes in the swiss cheese then burst, taking over from the performer and allowing him to catch his breath&quot;.\r\n*Jew’s Harp (aka Mouth Harp)- Probably the least obscure instrument to make the shirt. Be careful not to chip a tooth!\r\n*Kudu Horn- Um, the horn of a Kudu. Animal horns have been used as instruments for many, many years. This one made the shirt mostly because of it’s unique, twisted shape.\r\n*Lagerphone- An Australian instrument covered in beer-bottle tops- a variation of the traditional aboriginal instrument using shells.\r\n*Musical Saw- I once “borrowed” my sister’s violin bow to see if I could get any sound out of our saw, and without much success. It probably did a number on her bow, too.\r\n*Octavin- A single-reed woodwind invented in 1893. It never caught on, which would make it that much cooler if you decide to learn to play it.\r\n*Quena- If you live in the Andes, this isn’t so obscure to you. The phrase &quot;vamos a ir a la quena&quot; may still bring back some painful memories…\r\n*Rastrophone- Italian film composer Mario Nascimbene devised a percussive instrument which he termed the Rastrophone. It gave a great thud sound with a creepy bone rattling type after effect. In 1981 he revealed that the Rastrophone was actually a garden rake.\r\n*Shulberry- Dave Zammit, once sound engineer for the 70’s progressive rock band “Gentle Giant”, explains that the band asked him to make an instrument for concerts that “had 3 strings that could be tuned to the chord used at the beginning and within the song Playing the Game, thus making it unneccessary to purchase a Marimba as was used on the Album”.\r\n*Theremin- You’ve heard this in your favorite B-movies, much to the chagrin of the more serious players. Pitch and volume are controlled by the hands’ relative position to two metal antennas.\r\n*Tromboon- &quot;Professor&quot; Peter Schickele called it &quot;a hybrid —that&#39;s the nicer word— constructed from the parts of a bassoon and a trombone; it has all the disadvantages of both.” (Look up “P. D. Q. Bach”).\r\n*Wal Triple-Neck Bass- Created at Rick Wakeman’s request and eventually given to his Yes bandmate Chris Squire. “What’s the point?”, many ask when they see its apparent excess. Listen to the track “Awaken” and you’ll get the point.\r\n*Whamala- A single-stringed electronic instrument inspired by the washtub bass, made famous by Les Claypool of Primus.\r\n*Zither- Many cultures have their version of this stringed instrument. But what can be cooler than one shaped like a crocodile?",

I also have several designs with two or even three colors printed on them, whereas 99% of the other ties you&#39;ll see on Etsy are printed with only one ink color.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also been selling silkscreened shirts on Etsy for about six years in my other shop: http://www.etsy.com/shop/ScatterbrainTees\r\n\r\nInterested in a variation of what you see? Want it on a different color, on silk, or a skinny or long tie? Just contact me and I will try and find something that works for you. ",

Please note that shipping times are NOT guaranteed unless specifically mentioned in correspondence with you. The USPS gives shipping times that are the normal transit time for a given shipping class.

Please understand this is beyond our control. If you need an item to arrive in a guaranteed time frame, you will need to pay for a more expensive, guaranteed service, such as Express Priority or FedEx. If you have any questions, please contact us. \r\n\r\n***Within the US and Canada: Items below a certain weight are shipped first class. Anything heavier is shipped Priority Mail.\r\n\r\n***International shipping:\r\n\r\nShipping internationally may cause your parcel to attract duties and custom fees. They are the responsibility of the buyer. Please contact your local customs organization for more information. I will not mark items as &quot;gift&quot; unless it is a gift you are sending to someone outside of your home. \r\n\r\n***All packages are shipped with a tracking number. You will receive a message telling you your package has shipped and will be provided with a tracking number.

For instance, the process of screen printing onto clothing is very involved, and some custom orders would potentially take many hours to execute. Generally I don&#39;t do custom orders with designs that aren&#39;t already in my shop. Occasionally I will do print jobs if you have an image ready and if it&#39;s a large enough order. Still, please ask me and I&#39;ll let you know what it possible! \r\n\r\n***Feedback: Positive feedback is very much appreciated.
